BRAIN TUMOR CLASSIFICATION USING COMBINATION PRETRAINED CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) MODELS

Here, I try to improve the process of transfer learning (TL) by combining two pre-trained CNN models which are InceptionV3, MobilenetV3 to detect of brain tumor.
# Project Title

This project uses various machine learning and data processing libraries to perform image processing tasks.

## Prerequisites

This project is run on **Anaconda** and **Jupyter Notebook**. Make sure you have them installed on your system. If not, you can download and install them from the following links:

- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
- keras
- sklearn
- cv2 (OpenCV)
- PIL (Pillow)
- glob
- os
- shutil

You can install these packages using `pip` or `conda`. Here's how you can install them using `conda`:
